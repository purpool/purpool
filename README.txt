How to configure PurpoolPurpool is a workplace based social networking site that centers on thecommute and promotes ride-sharing as a community building activity.Participants have profiles and join carpool groups called pools. Bymaking this program workplace-specific, we are building off alreadyexisting trust networks made up of people who share similar commutingpatterns. Purpool was first conceived By Peter Ohring and Brooke Singer,faculty members in the New Media program at Purchase College, SUNY, inPurchase, NY, in 2006. We have since redesigned the application andadded a number of new features that we think will greatly help infacilitating ride-sharing, such as an application for schedulingride-shares and savings visualizations. The visualizations are importantbecause they give members a better understanding of how their behaviorshave real consequences on large-scale problems like reduction ofemissions and oil consumption. The development of this version ofPurpool was supported by an award from the New York State EnergyResearch and Development Authority (NYSERDA).Purpool is a web application built using PHP and MySQL, and relies onPEAR, MDB2, and Smarty (a templating language). Some of the datavisualizations make use of flash; the JavaScript libraries prototype andjquery are used.Purpool uses googlemaps for visualizing carpool routes and otherlocative information. This requires signing up for a googlemaps api key.You will need to complete these tasks before running the application:¥ Install Purpool MySQL database. Create your purpool database andimport the provided sql file. ¥ Make sure purpool_common directory iswritable by the web server ¥ Install Pear ¥ Install MDB2 ¥ Obtain agooglemaps api key (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html) ¥ Editthe purpool_common/includes/config.php file:It is recommended that the purpool_common directory be located outsideof the root web directory to provide an extra level of security. Youwill need to manually edit the config_path variable in theconfig_path.php file to describe the path to the purpool_common/includes/config.php file which in turn points to other resources.Config_path.php is located in the root (purpool) web directory.You will need to edit the config file (config.php inpurpool_common/includes) to describe your installation of purpoolincluding * database information * the base directories for the root(purpool) web directory and for the purpool_common directory * The adminpassword * An email address for admin related notifications * Theabsolute url of your site * The googlemaps keySet up cron task You will need to set up a single cron job that runsevery 15 minutes, and in turn executes a number of scripts to facilitatethe functioning of the Purpool application (updates gas prices on aweekly basis) and the communication between carpool members (sends outvarious reminders to pool members).  Below is an example of a line ofcode that you could enter into crontab to run the required cron tasks.15 * * * * /usr/bin/wget 'http://your.server.name/purpool/cron/cron.php'Access the admin app by opening the home web page and signing in usingthe admin email address and admin password, as entered into the configfile. Here you will be able to set up a workplace community byspecifying the location of the workplace and the email suffix used atthe workplace. This will allow people with an email addresscorresponding to the workplace email suffix to register and begin usingPurpool.
